## Version 2.0
The idea is to rewrite some aspects of the application while keeping it simple and basic for anyone at any level to understand what's happening. Here are some areas I'm looking at improving, and new features I intend to add:
- Application UI
- Products and Variations
- Inventory and Warehousing
- Sales
- Basic Accounting
- Cart
- POS
- Sales/Purchases/Dealers/Brands
- Backup
- Multi-tenancy
 
The goal is to improve on how the current application works **while maintaining simplicity for developers at any level**.

I'll elaborate more on this, but for now this should do.
